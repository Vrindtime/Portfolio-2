                    As a BCA student,

                    languages such as Java and
                    databases. In addition,
                    I have honed my skills
                    in video editing using
                    Premiere Pro and After Effects,
                    which contributes to my
                    ability to create engaging
                    content for my YouTube channel.
                    Overall, my diverse skill
                    set in coding and content
                    creation allows me to approach
                    projects with a unique perspective
                    and creativity.
